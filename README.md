Phone Book App to save your contacts information.

"Add Contact" button will redirect to a form for creating a new contact entry. 
In the form you can add contact information as needed including an image, First Name, Last Name, Mobile, Home, Work Address and Other.

In the contacts list you can press the pin icon in a specific entry to pin the contact at the top of the list. Press the pin again to undo.
You can press on any contact entry to display more details.

In the display section you can press the pencil icon to edit the contact information or delete the contact from the phone book.

"Delete All" will erase the whole contact list.

Things I wanted to add but didn't have enough time (study in the university):
+ Create a confirmation modal when pressing delete buttons.
+ Add validation to each contact information field. (for example: if the field defined as "email" only email can be inserted)
+ Add sorting options by different categories.

The contacts are saved in the local storage of the browser. 
Any delete action (of a specific contact or all the contacts) will remove the contact(s) from the local storage.
